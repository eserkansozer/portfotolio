    <h2>
        What is this site?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This site is an alternative <a href="http://flickr.com" title="flickr">flickr</a>
            viewer, developed by @Html.ActionLink("medvekoma", "photos", "photo", new { id = "medvekoma" }, null),
            aiming to help photographers showcase their portfolio and find inspiration in the
            works of other photographers.</li>
        <li>It also features a recommendation engine, which - based on what one marks as favorite
            - suggests other photos of interest. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Copyright information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All images are copyrighted by their respective owners. The photos shown here are
            taken by many different photographers, all of whom are flickr members.</li>
        <li>This site is a viewer application: it does not store images and personal data, and
            it does not reference any user or photo specifically.</li>
        <li>The site uses a technology called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking"
            title="inline linking">inline linking</a> to show the images stored on flickr's
            servers. According to international law, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking#Copyright_law_issues_that_inline_linking_raises"
                title="copyright issues">this is not a copyright infringement</a>. However,
            as you will see below, you can remove your photos from this site quickly.</li>
        <li>The application is designed to increase the visibility of the original flickr site.
            Photos are only shown in their small size, and they all link back to the original
            flickr page of the photo, where you can contact the photographer, add them as a
            contact, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Why I can see my photos here?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you publish public photos on flickr, they can appear on this site. As an alternative
            flickr viewer, this site uses the official flickr API - just like hundreds of other
            third party applications do.</li>
        <li>It doesn't copy, store or host any photos and doesn't reference any user specifically
            - it is merely a viewer that reflects whatever flickr provides it when you ask it
            to. </li>
        <li>The site is fully compliant with the terms of use of flickr API: all images link
            back to the original Flickr page - so there can be no misunderstanding about the
            image origin, author or copyright. You can also read the official Flickr FAQ about
            this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/website/#180" title="FAQ">here</a> and
            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/website/#181" title="FAQ2">here</a>. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Still, I don't want my photos here!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No problem. Go to the @Html.ActionLink("settings page", "show", "settings", null, new { rel = "nofollow" }), and
            hide your data from this application. </li>
        <li>Please <a href="http://www.flickr.com/mail/write/?to=27725019@N00">let us know</a>
            if you have any more questions, comments or concerns. </li>
    </ul>
